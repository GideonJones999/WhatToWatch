# WhatToWatch
## Elevator Pitch
Have you ever had a night when you wanted to watch a movie, but you didn't know what you wanted to watch? You have so many streaming services, and so many movies to choose! Well, this website will help you decide on what *you* want to watch.
Select your streaming service(s) of choice, and then "like" or "dislike" certain movies. The website will help figure out what kinds of movies you like, and then offer suggestions! If you set up a "group movie night", the website can filter all of your preferences together to help decide on what movie you all would like! Date night? No problem! The website can have a preference towards romances. ;)
